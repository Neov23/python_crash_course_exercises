# Dictionaries

- [Exercise 6-1](exercise_06_01.py):
Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their
first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You should have
keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece of
information stored in your dictionary.

- [Exercise 6-2](exercise_06_02.py):
Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and
use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each
person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name
and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some
actual data for your program.

- [Exercise 6-3](exercise_06_03.py):
A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to
avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

  - Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous
chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their
meanings as values.
  - Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might
print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on
one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline
character ('\n') to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your
output.

- [Exercise 6-4](exercise_06_04.py):
Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from
Exercise 6-3 (page 99) by replacing your series of print statements with a
loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. When you’re sure that
your loop works, add five more Python terms to your glossary. When you run
your program again, these new words and meanings should automatically be
included in the output.

- [Exercise 6-5](exercise_06_05.py):
Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river
runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.

  - Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs
through Egypt.
  - Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
  - Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

- [Exercise 6-6](exercise_06_06.py):
Use the code in favorite_languages.py (page 104).

  - Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include
some names that are already in the dictionary and some that are not.
  - Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have
already taken the poll, print a message thanking them for responding. If they
have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take the poll.

- [Exercise 6-7](exercise_06_07.py):
Start with the program you wrote for Exercise 6-1 (page 102). Make two new
dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionaries
in a list called people. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through
the list, print everything you know about each person.

- [Exercise 6-8](exercise_06_08.py):
Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a
pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name.
Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list
and as you do print everything you know about each pet.

- [Exercise 6-9](exercise_06_09.py):
Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys
in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To
make this exericse a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of
their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s
name and their favorite places.

- [Exercise 6-10](exercise_06_10.py):
Modify your program from Exercise 6-2 (page 102) so each person can have more
than one favorite number. Then print each person’s name along with their
favorite numbers.

- [Exercise 6-11](exercise_06_11.py):
Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your
dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the
country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about
that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like
country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the
information you have stored about it.
