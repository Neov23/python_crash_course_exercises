# User Input and while Loops

- [Exercise 7-1](exercise_07_01.py):
Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like.
Print a message about that car, such as "Let me see if I can find you a
Subaru".

- [Exercise 7-2](exercise_07_02.py):
Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group.
If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they’ll have to wait
for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

- [Exercise 7-3](exercise_07_03.py):
Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of
10 or not.

- [Exercise 7-4](exercise_07_04.py):
Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until
they enter a quit value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying
you’ll add that topping to their pizza.

- [Exercise 7-5](exercise_07_05.py):
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age.
If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; If they are between 3
and 12, the ticket is \$10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15.
Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of
their movie ticket.

- [Exercise 7-6](exercise_07_06.py):
Write three different versions of Exercise 7-4 or 7-5 that will do each of the
following at least one time:

  - Use a conditional check in the in the "while" command to stop the loop.
  - Use a variable "active" to check for how long the loop will run.
  - Use a break loop to exit the loop when the user input is "quit".

- [Exercise 7-7](exercise_07_07.py):
Write a loop that will never stop and let it run.

- [Exercise 7-8](exercise_07_08.py):
Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various
sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop through
the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as I made
your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished
sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing
each sandwich that was made.

- [Exercise 7-9](exercise_07_09.py):
Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich
'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code near the
beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of
pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurences of 'pastrami'
from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in
finished_sandiches.

- [Exercise 7-10](exercise_07_10.py):
Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation. Write a prompt
similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where would you go?
Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.
