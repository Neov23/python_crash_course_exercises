# Testing your code

- [Exercise 11-1](exercise_11_01/exercise_11_01.py):
Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.
The function should return a single string of the form City, Country, such as
Santiago, Chile. Store the function in a module called city_functions.py.
Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote
(remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test).
Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function
with values such as santiago and chile results in the correct string. Run
test_cities.py, and make sure test_city_country() passes.
**Modules:**
  - [city_functions.py](exercise_11_01/city_functions.py)

- [Exercise 11-2](exercise_11_02/exercise_11_02.py):
Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, population. It should
now return a single string of the form City, Country - population xxx, such as
Santiago, Chile - population 5000000. Run test_cities.py again. Make sure
test_city_country() fails this time.
Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run
test_cities.py again, and make sure test_city_country() passes again.
Write a second test called test_city_country_population() that verifies you
can call your function with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and
'population=5000000'. Run test_cities.py again, and make sure this new test
passes.
**Modules:**
  - [city_functions.py](exercise_11_02/city_functions.py)

- [Exercise 11-3](exercise_11_03.py):
Write a class called Employee. The `__init__()` method should take in a first
name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes.
Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by
default but also accepts a different raise amount.
Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods,
test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method
so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run
your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
