# Working with Lists

- [Exercise 4-1](exercise_04_01.py):
  - Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza
names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
  - Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have
one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
  - Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines about
the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really
love pizza!

- [Exercise 4-2](exercise_04_02.py):
  - Think at least three animals that have one common characteristic. Save the
names of the animals in a list and then use a "for" loop to display the name
of each animal.
  - Edit your program to display a statement for each animal, i.e "A dog would
make a great pet".
  - Add a line at the end of your program, that will state which is the common
characteristic of these animals, i.e. "Any of these animals would make a great
pet".

- [Exercise 4-3](exercise_04_03.py):
Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.

- [Exercise 4-4](exercise_04_04.py):
Create a list of number from 1 to 1.000.000 and then use "for" loop to display
the numbers. If the output is lengthy, stop the program ("ctrl+C" or close the
window)

- [Exercise 4-5](exercise_04_05.py):
Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use min() and
max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million.
Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add a million
numbers.

- [Exercise 4-6](exercise_04_06.py):
Use the third argument of the "range()" function to create a list of odd
numbers from 1 to 20. Use the "for" loop to display every number of the list.

- [Exercise 4-7](exercise_04_07.py):
Make a list of the multiples of 3, from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to print the
numbers in your list.

- [Exercise 4-8](exercise_04_08.py):
A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example, the cube of
2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that is,
the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out
the value of each cube.

- [Exercise 4-9](exercise_04_09.py):
Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first 10 cubes.

- [Exercise 4-10](exercise_04_10.py):
Use one of the programs you've written in this chapter and add a few lines at
the end of your program that will do the following:

  - Display the message "The first three items in the list are:". Then, use
slice to display the first three elements of the list.
  - Display the message "Three items from the middle of the list are:". Use
slice to display the three middle elements of the list.
  - Display the message "The last three items in the list are:". Use slice to
display the last three elements of the list.

- [Exercise 4-11](exercise_04_11.py):
Start with your program from Exercise 4-1 (page 60). Make a copy of the list
of pizzas, and call it friend_pizzas. Then, do the following:

  - Add a new pizza to the original list.
  - Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.
  - Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message, My favorite pizzas
are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message, My
friendâ€™s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second
list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.

- [Exercise 4-12](exercise_04_12.py):
All versions of "*foods*.*py*" in this chapter have avoided the use of "for" loop
in display, to save space. Choose a version of "*foods*.*py*" and write two "for"
loops to display each food list.

- [Exercise 4-13](exercise_04_13.py):
A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple
foods, and store them in a tuple.

  - Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
  - Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the
change.
  - The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different
foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop
to print each of the items on the revised menu.
