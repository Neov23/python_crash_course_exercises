# Introducing Lists

- [Exercise 3-1](exercise_03_01.py):
Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each
person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

- [Exercise 3-2](exercise_03_02.py):
Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing
each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should
be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

- [Exercise 3-3](exercise_03_03.py):
Think about your favorite transportation method. For example, motorbike or
car, and create a list that'll include some of the examples. Use your list
to display a line of declarations about the specific elements, for example
"I would like to own a Honda motorcycle".

- [Exercise 3-4](exercise_03_04.py):
If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you
invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite
to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting
them to dinner.

- [Exercise 3-5](exercise_03_05.py):
You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to
send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to
invite.

  - Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the end
of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
  - Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
the name of the new person you are inviting.
  - Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
in your list.

- [Exercise 3-6](exercise_03_06.py):
You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think
of three more guests to invite to dinner.

  - Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or Exercise 3-5. Add a print
statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a
bigger dinner table.

  - Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.

  - Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.

  - Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. Print a new set
of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

- [Exercise 3-7](exercise_03_07.py):
You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the
dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

  - Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. Add a new line that prints a
message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

  - Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two
names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite
them to dinner.

  - Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them
know they’re still invited.

  - Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty
list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the
end of your program.

- [Exercise 3-8](exercise_03_08.py):
Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.

  - Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical
order.

  - Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list
neatly, just print it as a raw Python list.

  - Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying
the actual list.

  - Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.

  - Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without
changing the order of the original list.

  - Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.

  - Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show
that its order has changed.

  - Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to
show it’s back to its original order.

  - Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print
the list to show that its order has been changed.

  - Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical
order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.

- [Exercise 3-9](exercise_03_09.py):
With one of the programs you created in exercises 3-4 to 3-7, use the
len() function to display a message that'll imply the number of people
you have invited to dinner.

- [Exercise 3-10](exercise_03_10.py):
Think about something you could save into a list. For example, you could
build a list with mountains, rivers, cities, languages or anything else.
Write a program that will create a list that will include these elements
and then use at least one time every function that you've learned in
this chapter.
