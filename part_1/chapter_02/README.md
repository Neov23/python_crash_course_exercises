- [Exercise 2-1](exercise_02_01.py):
Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.

- [Exercise 2-2](exercise_02_02.py):
Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value
of your variable to a new message, and print the new message.

- [Exercise 2-3](exercise_02_03.py):
Use a variable to represent a person's name and display a message to this
person. Your message should be simple, for example "Hello Eric, would you
like to learn some Python today?"

- [Exercise 2-4](exercise_02_04.py):
Use a variable to represent a person's name and display the name in lower
case, upper case, and title case.

- [Exercise 2-5](exercise_02_05.py):
Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of
its author. Your output should look something like the following, including
the quotation marks:
Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried
anything new.”

- [Exercise 2-6](exercise_02_06.py):
Repeat exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous person's name with
the variable "famous_person". Then, infuse the message and represent it to
the new variable "message". Display your message.

- [Exercise 2-7](exercise_02_07.py):
  - Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace
characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
character combination, “\t” and “\n”, at least once.

  - Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then
print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
rstrip(), and strip().

- [Exercise 2-8](exercise_02_08.py):
Write mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication
division). Each of the operations should give for outcome the number 8.
Confirm that you're enwrapping your operations inside print() bracket,
to be able to see the results. You'll have to create four lines that'll
look like this: #print(5+3)
Your output will be four lines, with the number 8 being displayed in each
line.

- [Exercise 2-9](exercise_02_09.py):
Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, using that
